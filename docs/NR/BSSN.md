Decomposing the three metric and the extrinsic curvature according to 

$$
\begin{aligned} \gamma_{i j} &=e^{4 \phi} \tilde{\gamma}_{i j} \\ K_{i j} &=e^{4 \phi}\left(\tilde{A}_{i j}+\frac{1}{3} \tilde{\gamma}_{i j} K\right) \end{aligned}
$$

where $\tilde{\gamma}_{i j}$ has unit determinant and $K=\gamma^{i j} K_{i j}$ is the mean curvature, the evolution equations are obtained from




The freedom to choose the coordinate gauge allows one to complete the evolution system in many different ways, and this can also lead to many different systems of equations, each one with 1ts own structure.

The BSSN variables are $\phi$, $g_{a b}$, $A_{a b}$, $K$, and $\Gamma^{a}$.






Firstly, the spatial metric $\gamma_{i j}$ is split into an overall conformal factor $e^{\phi}$ and a conformal metric $\tilde{\gamma}_{i j}$, where $e^{4 \phi} \tilde{\gamma}_{i j}=\gamma_{i j}$. and the determinant of $\tilde{\gamma}_{i j}$ is unity. This conformal metric has its corresponding Christoffel symbols $^{(3)} \widetilde{\Gamma}^{k}_{i j}$ and Ricci tensor $^{(3)} \tilde{R}_{i j}$. Second, the three combinations $\tilde{\gamma}^{i j} {}^{(3)} \tilde{\gamma}^k_{i j}={}^{(3)} \tilde{\Gamma}^{k}(k=1,2,3)$, as well as the $K=\gamma^{i j} K_{i j}$ are promoted to evolved variables. Third, the remaining evolved extrinsic curvature variables are trace-free conformal extrinsic curvature variables $\tilde{A}_{i j}=e^{-4 \phi}\left[K_{i j}-(1 / 3) K \gamma_{i j}\right]$. Finally, the momentum constraint equations are used to modify the evolution equations for ${}^{(3)} \tilde{\Gamma}^{k}$, which introduces a constraint damping quality to the system. These changes, in conjunction with a particular choice of gauge conditions, namely the use of certain Bona-Masso type lapse conditions (known as 1+log slicing) and Î“- driver shift conditions led to the first genuinely stable, fully nonlinear implementations of the Einstein equations for systems without symmetries, at least for non-black-hole spacetimes. The factoring out of the conformal factor $\phi$ proved to be particularly advantageous for collisions of black holes.
