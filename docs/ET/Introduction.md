The name Cactus comes from the design of a central core (or flesh) which connects to application modules (or thorns) through an extensible interface.

The Cactus API supports C/C++ and F77/F90 programming languages for the thorns. This makes it easier for scientists to turn existing codes into thorns which can then make use of the complete Cactus infrastructure, and in turn be used by other thorns within Cactus.

The [Einstein Toolkit](https://www.einsteintoolkit.org/index.html) is a community-driven software platform of core computational tools to advance and support research in relativistic astrophysics and gravitational physics.
