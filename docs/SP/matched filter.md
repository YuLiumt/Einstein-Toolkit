Let h be the gravitational-wave signal we are looking for and let 𝑛 be the detector’s noise. For convenience we assume that the signal h is a continuous function of time 𝑡 and that the noise 𝑛 is a continuous random process.

Assuming that the noise is additive the data $x$ can be written as

$$
x(t)=n(t)+h(t)
$$
